Known Issues:

1. When adding an apartment, entering a value that is not within the defined range or is invalid
 results in a printout of the nature of the error and an exit to the main menu (update - 28/8/2022)

2. I believe that the code is a bit cumbersome but this is the best implementation
 I found that works properly, I think that in some places it could be improved. 

3. When asking to see the most expensive apartment for rent, if you want to add a new type
 of apartment for rent, it is critical to make sure that the class name contains "rent".

4. The sorting performed in operation 8 is not effective at all in my opinion
 and of course it would have been better to use the built-in Sort function of ArrayList.
